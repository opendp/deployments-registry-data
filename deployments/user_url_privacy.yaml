    privacy_unit_description: |
      - '"The privacy protections are “action level” (rather than the more familiar “user-level” differential
      privacy) in that the granularity of what is protected is not a single user, but rather a single action,
      or user-URL-action (e.g. a user sharing a specific URL)."'
      - However, there are a limited number of actions, and total user level loss is also computed and reported for this entry.

    privacy_parameters_description:
      - '"At \\(\delta = 10−5)\\, the \\(\epsilon_{user})\\ for each individual action type decreases from about 0.45 (as reported
      in an earlier section) to a range between 0.34 and 0.35. The total user-level privacy consumption across all action types under
      \\(\mu)\\-GDP is about 0.376. The total user-level privacy consumption across all action types reduces from an epsilon of 1.844
      (reported in an earlier section) to about 1.453. To reiterate, the privacy consumption under \\(\rho)\\-zCDP is unchanged:
      \\(\rho_{user})\\ remains at 0.0052 for each individual action column and remains at 0.0728 across the entire dataset."'
