  data_product_description: Aggregate Statistics. Global. Thus, each daily place visit
    is protected by diﬀerential privacy with ε = 0.44. These multiple metrics apply
    to the same dataset, so standard composition results apply, and the total daily
    contribution of each user is protected by diﬀerential privacy with a maximum of
    ε = 1.76. (...) We are generating a ﬁxed set of metrics (all possible combinations
    of geographic regions, days within the periods, and public place categories),
    and we are also adding noise to zero-valued metrics. As such, the process outlined
    above is ε-diﬀerentially private with δ = 0.
