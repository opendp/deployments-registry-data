  description: Thus, each daily place visit is protected by diﬀerential
    privacy with ε = 0.44. These multiple metrics apply to the same dataset, so standard
    composition results apply, and the total daily contribution of each user is protected
    by diﬀerential privacy with a maximum of ε = 1.76. (...) We are generating a ﬁxed
    set of metrics (all possible combinations of geographic regions, days within the
    periods, and public place categories), and we are also adding noise to zero-valued
    metrics. As such, the process outlined above is ε-diﬀerentially private with δ
    = 0.
