    "Therefore each report is (1.2, 10−10)-DP because the ratio
    that uses both counts accumulates the privacy loss.  Therefore, for each report
    date, we guarantee the top-employer reports are together (4.8, 4 × 10−10)-DP."

      "For this use case we use event-level privacy, where the event is a user being
      hired. We note that in our dataset, in any given 3 month period at least 95% of users are hired at
      most once...Similarly, we guarantee that each month, the top-jobs query is (4.8, 4 × 10−10)-DP."
