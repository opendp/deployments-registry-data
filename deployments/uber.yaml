  product:
    name: FLEX
    data_curators:
      - Uber
    intended_use: To compute privacy-protected SQL queries using existing SQL
      databases, in real time, at millions-of-records scale
    data_product_type: SQL queries
    data_product_region: Global
    description: A flexible end-to-end system for computing differential privacy
      using "elastic sensitivity" over heterogeneous existing database
      environments, at scale.
    publication_date: 2018-01-01
    data_product_sector: Technology
  dp_flavor:
    name: Approximate DP
    output_measure: elastic sensitivity (upper bound on local sensitivity)
    data_domain: Multi-table relational database (schema unspecifed)
    unprotected_quantities: bin labels drawn from finite domains
  privacy_loss:
    privacy_unit: Tuple-level
    privacy_unit_description: |
      Each record corresponds to a tuple in a single table
      of a multi-table database. Tuples do not necessarily correspond to
      individuals.
    privacy_parameters:
      epsilon: 0.01
      delta: 'n^{(-\epsilon \ln(n))}'
      privacy_parameters_description: 'these parameters are used for evaluating the deployment, in operation the parameters are set by users on query-by-query basis'

  model:
    model_name: Central
    model_name_description: '"In this [system] we [implement] bounded differential privacy,in which x can be obtained from its neighbor y by changing (but not adding or removing) a single tuple."'
    actors: >
      - domains of observation: rider and driver information, trip logs, andcustomer support interactions
      - units of observation:  unspecified
      - local data collection:  unspecified
      - network adversary: unspecified
      - database controller: central controller of secure database
      - internal database users: designs, executes and receives database queries
    release_type: Many releases
    release_type_description: 'Many different queries over the  database, no restriction against repeated queries over time'
    data_source_type: Dynamic
    data_source_type_description: Database is updated dynamically through unspecified business processes
    access_type: Interactive
    access_type_description: 'Authorized internal users design, execute, and receive multiple queries over an extended period of time. Privacy parameters are  determined by user, at request time.'
  accounting:
    post_processing: none described
    composition: |
      - deployment does not manage privacy budgets
      - user can compute overall privacy loss using strong composition bounds on sequential queries
  implementation:
    pre_processing_eda_hyperparameter_tuning: none described
    mechanisms: |
      - The differential privacy algorithm used is bounded epsilon-delta  DP
      - details:
        - SQL query is analyzed compute elastic sensitivity
        - smooth sensitivity is applied to elastic sensitivity query
        - Laplace noise is added  to query results
      - No information was provided about the implementation of the mechanism.
      - No information was provided about protection against floating point errors
      - No information was provided about protection from timing attacks.
      - No information was provided about leakage due to idiosyncrasies of the computing platform.
      - Security measure to protect underlying data: none measured
    justification: |
      - Formal proof that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound of local sensistivity is presented.
