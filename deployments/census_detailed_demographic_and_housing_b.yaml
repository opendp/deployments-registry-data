    name: Disclosure Avoidance System for Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B
    data_curators:
      - U.S. Census Bureau
    intended_use: The Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics data file B (Detailed DHC-B, or DDHC-B) provides household type (e.g., family or nonfamily) and tenure (e.g., whether the home is owned or rented) for approximately 1,500 detailed race and ethnic groups and detailed American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) areas within the United States. These data are used for assessing and allocating funding for government programs and by researchers such as demographers and economists.
    data_product_type: Summary statistics
    data_product_region: USA
    description: Set of summary statistics (tables with household type and tenure type statistics) published as the 2020 Census Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B.

    data_domain: The Detailed DHC-B contains the data compiled from the questions on race, ethnicity, and housing asked of all people in the 2020 Census.
    unprotected_quantities: |
      - The total population count for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
      - The total count of housing units in each census block.
      - The count and type of occupied group quarters facilities in each census block. The specific types of group quarters facilities that are invariant are:
        - Correctional facilities for adults
        - Juvenile facilities
        - Nursing facilities/skilled-nursing facilities
        - Other institutional facilities
        - College/university student housing
        - Military quarters
        - Other noninstitutional facilities

  privacy_loss:
    privacy_unit: Person-level
    privacy_unit_description: The privacy unit is person-level records for Person tables and housing-unit-level records for Housing Unit tables. The system uses a “bounded neighbors” definition of adjacency because the total population count of the United States and Puerto Rico is held invariant. Therefore, adjacent datasets are two CEFs that differ by the modification of a single person's record (e.g., a change to a person’s census block location), while the total number of records remains the same. The function that computes the distance between any two datasets in the data domain is the change-one distance, and the maximum distance between any two datasets in the data domain is one.
    privacy_parameters:
      rho: 17.79
    privacy_parameters_description: |
      - The final global privacy-loss budget for the 2020 Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics B data was \\(\rho\\)  = 17.79.
      - This global budget is not applied uniformly. It is strategically allocated across different detailed and regional geographic levels (e.g., state, county, Census tract) and then further divided household type and tenure at each of those levels. The precise allocation proportions are detailed on page 4-3 of the Detailed DHC-B Technical Documentation paper.

    actors: |
      - Curator: U.S. Census Bureau: collects, stores, and protects the confidential data
      - Data subjects: The respondents of the 2020 Census, comprising over 331 million people in the United States. Their trust in the curator's ability to protect their data is essential for the quality of the census. This trust is rationalized by the Bureau's legal mandate under Title 13 of the U.S. Code to protect respondent confidentiality, a requirement reinforced by a lifelong oath taken by every employee.
      - Data users: A wide-ranging group including state governments for redistricting and government program spending allocation, the U.S. Department of Justice for Voting Rights Act analysis, demographic and economic researchers, public policy makers, and the general public.
      - Adversaries: The system is designed to protect against a wide range of potential attackers. This includes sophisticated actors who may have access to large external databases, powerful computing resources, and advanced algorithms , as well as state actors like foreign governments, corporations, and cybercriminals.

  accounting:
    post_processing: |
      The Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B is not consistent with the Redistricting Data (PL 94-171) Summary File, the Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC), or the Demographic Profile. Key post-processing functions include:
        - Inconsistencies From the Noise Necessary to Protect Confidentiality: Because of the way noise is applied to data to protect respondent confidentiality, aggregating counts can result in noisier (or less accurate) data.
        - Inconsistent Data Because of Minimal Postprocessing Consistency Requirements: Noise is applied indepen- dently to each group at every geography level. This means that geographic hierarchies were not considered when applying noise to the data.
        - Data Suppression: There are suppressed values in the Detailed DHC-B. Suppression was applied to counts in one of two ways: individual data cells and whole tables.
          - An “X” appears in the data cell when an individual count was suppressed because of data reasonableness requirements.
          - Whole tables were suppressed for detailed and regional groups because of population thresholds. These population thresholds ensure that published population counts reflect positive enumerated counts 99.99 percent of the time.

  implementation:
    mechanisms: |
      - The SafeTab-H algorithm works by calculating statistics using the confidential 2020 Census data, then adds or subtracts a small amount of statistical noise to those statistics. The amount of noise added or subtracted from each statistic is determined by the privacy-loss budget (PLB) assigned to the calculation of that statistic. PLB allocations were determined to ensure that all tables included in the Detailed DHC-B meet preestablished margins of error (uncertainty) at least 95 percent of the time.
      - SafeTab-H produces privacy-protected counts for each count and geography independently and does not enforce consistency, so counts within the Detailed DHC-B may not be consistent with related counts in this or other 2020 Census data products.
      - The system was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau using the Tumult Analytics (https://tmlt.dev/) platform. Link to DAS 2020 Detailed DHC-B production code: https://github.com/uscensusbureau/DAS_2020_DDHCB_Production_Code
      - Security measures:
        - Legal: Protection is legally mandated by Title 13 of the U.S. Code.
        - All Census Bureau employees take a lifelong oath to protect respondent information.

    justification: |
      - Rationale for Adopting DP: Differential privacy was adopted after internal research confirmed that traditional disclosure avoidance methods, like data swapping, were vulnerable to modern database reconstruction and re-identification attacks. A 2018 simulation of such an attack on the 2010 Census data resulted in the confirmed re-identification of 52 million people (17% of the U.S. population). DP was chosen because it provides mathematically provable guarantees against a wide range of such privacy attacks.
      - Rationale for Specific Mechanisms:
        - The trusted-curator (central) model was chosen because it is more statistically efficient than a local model, yielding more accurate data for the same level of privacy protection.
        - The discrete Gaussian mechanism was chosen over the geometric mechanism (used in earlier prototypes) after empirical tests demonstrated it provided better accuracy. Its statistical properties (specifically, having smaller tail probabilities) reduce the worst-case errors that can arise during the post-processing step of creating non-negative integer microdata.
      - Validation and Verification:
        - The system was validated through a series of public demonstration data product releases using 2010 data
        - The Census Bureau solicited and incorporated detailed feedback from a wide array of stakeholders, including the National Academy of Sciences, federal and state partners, academic researchers, and tribal leaders.
        - The final production parameters were set by the Data Stewardship Executive Policy Committee (DSEP) after a final review of the privacy guarantees and data accuracy demonstrated in the tuning experiments.
