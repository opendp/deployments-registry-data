      '"This dataset contains trip flow information from over 300 million people world-wide (including residents and visitors of cities)
      for the year 2016, aggregated weekly and with spatial granularity corresponding to S2 cells of approximately 1.27 km\\(^2\\). ...
      All trips were anonymized and aggregated by jointly applying differential privacy via the Laplace mechanism in combination with k-anonymity."'

      '"The automated Laplace mechanism adds random noise drawn
      from a zero mean Laplace distribution and yields (\\(\epsilon, \delta\\))-differential privacy guarantee
      of \\(\epsilon = 0.66\\) and \\(\delta = 2.1 × 10−29\\), which is very strong."'
