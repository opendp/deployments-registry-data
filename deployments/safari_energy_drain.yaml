  product:
    name: Safari Energy Draining and Crashing Domains
    data_curators:
      - Apple
    intended_use: Browser Statistics
    data_product_type: Summary statistics
    data_product_region: Global
    data_product_sector: Technology
    description: Identify sites with high memory or high CPU usage.
    publication_date: '2017-01-01'

  dp_flavor:
    name: Pure DP
    data_domain: 'Event-level dataset where one "event" is a web browser loading a  page, and the "measure" is the domain of the page loaded.'
    unprotected_quantities: |
          - The dictionary of websites (a predefined set of D websites).
          - Algorithm parameters: the PHCMS algorithm requires the number of hash functions (m), and the size of the privatized vector (k).
          - The total number of records (known by the server, although not released).
          - IP addresses and and user identity are transmitted to server, but then deleted and not used for further computations.

  privacy_loss:
    privacy_unit: event-level
    privacy_unit_description: '"Data is privatized on the user’s device using event-level differential privacy"'
    privacy_parameters:
      epsilon: 4.0
    privacy_parameters_description: '"For this use case, we set the parameters for HCMS to be m = 32,768, k = 1024, and \\(\epsilon\\) = 4 with p = 250,000 web domains."'

  model:
    model_name: Local
    model_name_description: '"[W]e choose not to collect raw data on the server which is required for central differential privacy; hence, we adopt local differential privacy, which is a superior form of privacy..."'
    release_type: Multiple releases # Note -- there are multiple releases per device & per user -- statistics are reported automatically on IoS and MacOS devices, subject to daily aggregation. There is only one aggregation query applied per-event.
    release_type_description: Daily
    access_type: Non-interactive # pre-defined query

  accounting:
    post_processing: |
      - Server strips IP addresses and  associated ids from each record.
      - Aggregation - private histograms are generated through sketch mechanism PHCMS
      - Threshold - only domain elements with counts above threshold T (level undocumented) are disclosed

    composition: No information was provided about composition.

  implementation:
    pre_processing_eda_hyperparameter_tuning: 'No hyperperameters are required; no EDA is described'
    mechanisms: Private Hadamard Count Mean Sketch (PHCMS)
    justification: '"Formal proof, described in Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.3"'
