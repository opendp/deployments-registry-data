    "The Apple differential privacy implementation incorporates the concept of a per-
    donation privacy budget (quantified by the parameter epsilon), and sets a strict limit on
    the number of contributions from a user in order to preserve their privacy... For Lookup Hints, Apple uses a privacy budget with epsilon
    of 4, and limits user contributions to two donations per day."
