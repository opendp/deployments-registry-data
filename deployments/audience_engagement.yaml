    - Note: The paper states that “data is purged within 30 days of a user leaving the ecosystem because it has a 30 day retention.” We take this to mean that the data are refreshed on a monthly basis, i.e., that leaving the ecosystem means leaving a single user session on LinkedIn as opposed to account deletion.
