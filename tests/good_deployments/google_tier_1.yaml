  data_curator: Google
  intended_use: To help researchers, public health experts, and data analysts better understand the impact of COVID-19 via population-level symptom search trends
  data_product_type: Summary statistics
  data_product_region: Global
  data_product_description: A publicly released dataset of daily or weekly time series giving the relative frequency of searches for ~400 predefined symptoms in each geographic region, normalized by total search activity
  publication_date: "2020-09-01"

  # Tier 2?:
  # dp_flavor:
  #   name: Pure DP
  #   data_domain: Per-user Google search queries classified as “symptom searches” (from a predefined list of ~400 symptoms) and total search activity for normalization, aggregated as <day or week, symptom, region> at three geographic granularity levels
  #   unprotected_quantities: The predefined list of ~400 symptoms and the set of <day, symptom, region> combinations for which metrics are published, per-symptom contribution bound = 1, cross-symptom bound ≤ 3, normalization bound = 1 per user per region per period, scaling factor c for mapping to [0,100], and the DP daily-vs-weekly granularity decision step
  # privacy_loss:
  #   privacy_unit: user-day
  #   privacy_parameters:
  #     epsilon: 1.68
  #   # Tier 3?: privacy_unit_description: '“user-day”, with contribution bounding. A single privacy unit is all of one user’s searches on one day. Before adding noise, each user’s day is bounded so that they can contribute at most: 1 count per symptom and at most 3 symptom counts in total, plus at most 1 normalization count (one per day).'
  # model:
  #   model_type: Central
  #   # Tier 3?: model_type_description: 'Central DP: a trusted Google curator applies the Laplace mechanism via Google’s open-source DP library before any data release.'
  #   release_type: Continual
  #   # Tier 3?: release_type_description: 'Continual: new noisy aggregates are generated and published daily (or weekly).'
  #   interactivity: Non-interactive

  # Tier 3?:
  # additional_dp_information:
  #   post_processing: >
  #     A region-specific constant c is chosen once based on the February-July 2020 window to ensure we end up in a [0,100] percent scale.
  #     Unreliable metrics are removed based on a 50% confidence for the ratio deviating more than 25% from the true one.
  #     Deciding whether to release daily or weekly granularity is made once on the initial window for top-level geopolitical subdivisions (e.g., US states) or higher-resolution granularity (e.g., US counties). Release per country is always daily.
  #   composition: >
  #     Basic sequential composition (counting symptoms + normalization)
  # implementation:
  #   pre_processing_eda_hyperparameter_tuning: Not available
  #   mechanisms: Laplace mechanism for both symptom search and normalization counts via Google’s open-source DP library
  #   justification: Not available
