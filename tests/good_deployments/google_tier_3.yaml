  intended_use: To help researchers, public health experts, and data analysts better understand the impact of COVID-19 via population-level symptom search trends

  dp_flavor:
    name: Pure DP
    data_domain: Per-user Google search queries classified as “symptom searches” (from a predefined list of ~400 symptoms) and total search activity for normalization, aggregated as <day or week, symptom, region> at three geographic granularity levels
    unprotected_quantities: The predefined list of ~400 symptoms and the set of <day, symptom, region> combinations for which metrics are published, per-symptom contribution bound = 1, cross-symptom bound ≤ 3, normalization bound = 1 per user per region per period, scaling factor c for mapping to [0,100], and the DP daily-vs-weekly granularity decision step
  privacy_loss:
    privacy_unit: user-day
    privacy_parameters:
      epsilon: 1.68
    privacy_unit_description: '“user-day”, with contribution bounding. A single privacy unit is all of one user’s searches on one day. Before adding noise, each user’s day is bounded so that they can contribute at most: 1 count per symptom and at most 3 symptom counts in total, plus at most 1 normalization count (one per day).'

  accounting:
    post_processing: |
      A region-specific constant c is chosen once based on the February-July 2020 window to ensure we end up in a [0,100] percent scale.

      Unreliable metrics are removed based on a 50% confidence for the ratio deviating more than 25% from the true one.

      Deciding whether to release daily or weekly granularity is made once on the initial window for top-level geopolitical subdivisions (e.g., US states) or higher-resolution granularity (e.g., US counties). Release per country is always daily.
    composition: |
      Basic sequential composition (counting symptoms + normalization)

  implementation:

    mechanisms: Laplace mechanism for both symptom search and normalization counts via Google’s open-source DP library
    justification: Not available
